# sarbatori-legale

**sarbatori-legale** is a website made for Romanian students that displays a calendar with holidays.

## Why?

Sometimes I find it difficult to get the current year's holidays because they are written only in a text format. This project solves this problem

## Features
- **Holiday Info**: Every holiday is clickable and tells you what the holiday name is and the period.
- **Legal Holidays sepparation from School Holidays**: There are legal and school holidays sepparated trough colors.

## Technologies Used
- **React & Tailwind**: Base of the app.
- **Framer Motion**: To improve the visual experience.
